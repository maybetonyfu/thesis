\chapter{Background}

Programming in strongly typed languages has many advantages. It helps programmers identify logical errors before running the code, reduce maintenance difficulty, and improve the editor capability find documents and auto-complete code while typing. However, the difficulties in understanding and resolving type errors often ward people off  from practicing strongly typing.  In this Chapter, we discuss the relevant research in improving the experience of debugging type errors. We first investigate the theoretical approaches to enrich/correct the information presented type errors. We then  investigate the various designs of tools, interfaces, and visualizations to support understanding type errors.
