\chapter{\chameleon{}: Interactive Type Error Exploration}


\label{chap:chameleon} 

In this chapter, we explore the challenges associated with traditional tools for debugging type errors. We focus on their limitations in identifying all relevant locations, explaining errors in user-friendly language, and avoiding bias. We introduce Chameleon, a type error debugging tool for Haskell designed to address these challenges and present type errors in an optimized, comprehensible manner. We delve into the design of Chameleon and demonstrate its usage through examples of resolving type errors. Finally, we present our user studies, which are designed to evaluate the effectiveness of type error visualization and interactive debugging tools.


 This chapter uses the content from our paper \textit{ChameleonIDE: Untangling Type Errors Through Interactive Visualization and
Exploration} \cite{Fu2023-fm}, with slight modifications to ensure coherence within this thesis. This work was published and presented at the International Conference on Program Comprehension (ICPC) 2023.
