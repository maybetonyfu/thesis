\chapter{Chameleon: An MUS-based interactive type error visualization and explanation tool}


\label{chap:chameleon} 

In this chapter, we discuss the challenge of traditional tools for debugging type errors, in localization, language and bias-adverting. We introduce Chameleon, a type error debugging tool based on type error slicing and MUS. We discuss the design of Chameleon and its usage in example, and show that 1) Chameleon is able to address the challenges in traditional debugging tools, and 2) Chameleon's improvement over other slicing based tools.
