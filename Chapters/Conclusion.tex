\section{Summary of the work}


We contribute Chameleon, an interactive Haskell type error debugging tool. Internally, Chameleon computes all relevant locations that contribute to the type of error. Via a set of iteratively designed interface, Chameleon preserves the two alternatives of the type error and the supporting evidence for each.


We also contributed a series of studies of the effects of debugging with visual representation of types and interactively explored type errors. We show that there is a difference between using traditional tools and enhanced type error debugging tools like Chameleon. And we show that this difference is more significant when debugging complex type errors.

 

We contribute Goanna, a Haskell type error debugging tool. Like Chameleon, Goanna iterates relevant locations that contribute to the type error and presents alternatives to the type error. Different from Chameleon, Goanna will exhaust all possible alternative explanations of the type error. Also, Goanna presents a type error by dividing it into a list of potential causes and their respective fixes. With Goanna, Haskell programmers can resolve type errors by exploring a list of potential error root causes. These causes are ordered using our heuristics so that the more likely causes are on top. We show that via our empirical evaluation that Goanna outperforms existing Haskell compilers when explaining the type error, with the slight disadvantage of an increased computation time.


We contribute GeckoGraph, a graphic notation for Haskell types. GeckoGraph describes the same information as a type signature does, but uses colours, shapes, and symbols to make certain structures easy to identify at a glance. GeckoGraph is designed to use visual elements to improve the understanding of type-level concepts. This includes type classes, parametric type variables, and high-rank types. When used to compare two types, GeckoGraph helps clarify differences visually. It makes errors like too few or too many arguments in applications, unmet type class constraints obvious.


We conducted a large-scale study on the effectiveness of using GeckoGraph to perform a series of Haskell tasks. We concluded that with GeckoGraph, programmers are able to succeed in harder tasks.

\section{Conclusion}

This research was centered around two key questions: what are the specific tasks when dealing with type errors, and how can we improve interaction with them? From this work, we have proposed a novel classification of type errors, revealing that each category comes with its unique set of challenges. This has resulted in three distinct fields of exploration. 

This research, grounded in a human-centered approach, demonstrates promising methods to improve the way we interact with static type systems within contemporary programming environments. It provides a basis for future research in the field of type error debugging and paves the way for the development of new programming tools centered on simplifying the challenges of debugging type errors. 

\section{Future Work}

From the work presented in this thesis, we generalize
the tasks of debugging type errors and our proposed debugging techniques in a few idiomatic interations.  I have also envisioned a programming system that integrate these interations to provide a basis for future programming tool designs.



\subsection{Solution-based approach with chain-of-thought explaination}

This iteraction provide a  solution-driven debugging experience similar to Goana. Unlike Goanna, type error is iteractively explained by the locations that contribute to this type conflict.

\subsection{Using Graphic Representation of Types in Type Debugging}

In this example, graphic notation (GeckoGraph) is used to display the intermediate types that appears in the iterative explanation.

\subsection{Support for type classes}

  In this example, we use inline decoration elements in addtition to GeckoGraph to provide additional help for tracing errors involving type classes.
