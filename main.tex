% 

Static typing is a fundamental feature embedded in the origins of programming languages and is recognized for its numerous advantages, such as bug prevention, improved code quality, and decreased maintenance costs. Nevertheless, it presents considerable challenges, including a steep learning curve and slowed development pace, leading to a preference in recent years for lightweight dynamic languages like Python and JavaScript over statically typed languages such as Java and C++.  Paradoxically, while stronger and more advanced type systems prevent a greater number of bugs, they also make resolving type errors more difficult and pose a larger barrier for non-expert programmers. Over the years, significant efforts, including contributions of our own, have been made toward augmenting the usability of static types and type errors.

My research investigates the tasks of resolving type errors in Haskell, a function programming languages, and how these tasks can be improved. We propose a method of categorization of type errors by anlalyzing the patterns of the locations that lead to the type errors. This categorization reveals different challenges associated with different kinds of type errors. This understanding led to the development of three key interventions: \chameleon{}, Goanna, and GeckoGraph. \chameleon{} is a type error debugger that visualizes conflicting locations of type errors and provides a step-by-step interactive exploration of their occurrences. Goanna focuses on presenting all possible causes of a type error and, for each cause, offers a minimal yet comprehensive set of changes to resolve it. GeckoGraph, a graphical notation for types, offers a more concise language for representing type signatures in source code, documentation, and type errors. These contributions allow us to generalize the task of debugging type errors into several idiomatic interactions supported by common user interface design patterns. Building on this foundation, we envision a debugging system called \textit{TypeTutor} that integrates these idioms to create a natural and user-friendly approach to type error resolution.


By adopting multiple human-centered design methods, our research identifies promising avenues for enhancing our interaction with static-type systems in modern programming environments. We hope these findings will inform future studies aimed at improving type error debugging and inspire the development of next-generation programming tools to overcome the challenges of resolving type errors.
